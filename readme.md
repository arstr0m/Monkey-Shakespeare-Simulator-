# Monkey Shakespeare Simulator 🐒🐒🐒🐒
## **Overview**
The Monkey Shakespeare Simulator is a fun and illustrative Python project that uses multithreading to simulate the classic thought experiment: given infinite time and resources, could a group of monkeys randomly type out the complete works of Shakespeare? In this simulation, the monkeys are replaced by threads that generate random text, and we use a progress bar to visualize the search process.

## Idea Origin
The concept for this project is inspired by the "Infinite Monkey Theorem," a popular thought experiment in probability theory. The theorem posits that given an infinite amount of time, a monkey randomly pressing keys on a typewriter would eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare. This project brings that idea into the realm of programming, using threads to generate random text and a progress bar to track the search process.

## Features
Multithreading: Multiple threads (representing monkeys) generate random text concurrently.
Progress Bar: A real-time progress bar shows the elapsed time and approximate progress of the search.
Text Generation and Matching: Each thread generates random text and checks if it matches the target text.
Text Finding: Once the target text is found, the process stops, and the result is displayed.
